# CelesteExtractor

## Introduction

It is a tool to extract all atlas in Celeste.

## Download

Binary release can be found in [here](https://github.com/wtdcode/CelesteExtractor/releases).

## Usage

```batch
CelesteExtractor.exe [ContentDirectory] [OutputDirectory]
```

Pay attention to **ContentDirectory**. For example, if you have Celeste installed in `C:\Celeste`, the ContentDirectory should be `C:\Celeste\Content`.

If the output directory doesn't exist, it will create it for you.
